## Development
<p>
Creating a Tic Tac Toe game is my project 0 with General Assembly.
I had never created a full front end functioning game before, and I
really enjoyed the process. Hours of problem solving enticed me to keep
learning more and to do better.
As you can see from my wireframe the design changed the more I focused on
functionality.
For example, I put "forgot password" on the button in my wireframe
design, but there was no need, only "change password" was needed.
Currently the game plays well for ver 1.0!</p>

  ---*---
  In version 2.0
  I would like to create an intuitive feeling AI
  User can access how man wins & losses.
